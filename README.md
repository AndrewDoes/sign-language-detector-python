# sign-language-detector-python

Sign language detector with Python, OpenCV and Mediapipe !

I got these codes from this awesome guy here, God bless him

There are some modifications:
1. How I collected the image, I added flip image feature so you can use both hands to sign now
2. I changed the size to 100 dataset for 26 folders (all letters in the alphabet)
